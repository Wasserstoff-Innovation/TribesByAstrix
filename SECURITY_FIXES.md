# TribesByAstrix Security Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Banned Moderator Issue

**Problem**: Moderators with global rights could still exercise moderator powers in tribes they had been banned from, circumventing tribe-specific bans.

**Fix**: Updated the `onlyTribeAdmin` modifier in `TribeController.sol` to check if the user has been banned from the specific tribe, even if they have global moderator rights.

```solidity
modifier onlyTribeAdmin(uint256 tribeId) {
    require(
        (tribes[tribeId].admin == msg.sender || 
        roleManager.hasRole(keccak256(bytes("MODERATOR_ROLE")), msg.sender)) &&
        // Add check to ensure moderators aren't banned from the tribe they're trying to manage
        memberStatuses[tribeId][msg.sender] != MemberStatus.BANNED,
        "Not tribe admin"
    );
    _;
}
```

**Test**: `UserProfileAndTribeComprehensive.test.ts` verifies this fix.

### 2. Grandfathered Members After Tribe Gating Changes

**Problem**: When a tribe's gating requirements changed (e.g., adding NFT requirements), existing members retained their membership but were unable to perform actions like posting.

**Partial Fix**: Modified `TribeController.sol`'s `_validateNFTRequirements` function to automatically pass validation for members who already have ACTIVE status:

```solidity
function _validateNFTRequirements(uint256 tribeId, address user) internal view returns (bool) {
    // If the user is already an active member, they are grandfathered in
    // This allows existing members to retain access when a tribe changes its gating requirements
    if (isMember[tribeId][user] && memberStatuses[tribeId][user] == MemberStatus.ACTIVE) {
        return true;
    }
    
    // Rest of the validation logic...
}
```

**Remaining Issue**: Even though TribeController now recognizes existing members as valid, other contracts like PostMinter that interact with tribes need similar updates to fully respect grandfathered status.

## Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Cross-Contract Coordination**: Update all contracts that interact with tribes (PostMinter, etc.) to respect grandfathered membership status.

2. **Notifications on Requirement Changes**: Add events/signals when tribe gating changes to notify members of new requirements.

3. **Grace Period**: Consider adding a grace period for existing members to meet new requirements before restricting their permissions.

4. **Extended Testing**: Add additional edge case tests for interactions between multiple contracts with different permission models.

## Test Documentation

The file `test/journey/UserProfileAndTribeComprehensive.test.ts` contains tests that verify these issues and their fixes.

```typescript
// Test 1: Verifies that banned moderators cannot perform admin actions
it("Forbidden test: Should prevent banned moderator from exercising moderator powers", async function () {
    // Test implementation...
});

// Test 2: Documents the partial fix for grandfathered members
it("Forbidden test: Should handle changing tribe gating after member joins", async function () {
    // Test implementation...
});
```
