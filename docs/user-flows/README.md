# Tribes by Astrix User Flows

This directory contains comprehensive documentation of the user flows and journeys implemented in the Tribes by Astrix platform, as validated through our test suite.

## Overview

The Tribes by Astrix platform supports various user interactions across different modules:

1. **Tribes Management** - Creating and joining tribes, member management
2. **Fundraising** - Creating and contributing to fundraisers within tribes
3. **Events** - Organizing events, purchasing tickets, and managing event lifecycle
4. **Content** - Creating, sharing, and interacting with posts
5. **Profiles** - Managing user profiles and reputation

## Flow Documentation

Each module has its own set of user flows documented in detail:

- [Fundraiser User Flows](./FundraiserUserFlows.md) - Documentation of fundraiser creation, contribution, and management flows
- [Event User Flows](./EventUserFlows.md) - Documentation of event creation, ticket purchasing, and event management flows

## System Architecture

For a comprehensive view of how these flows fit into the overall system architecture:

- [System Architecture Diagrams](./SystemArchitecture.md) - Visual representations of the contract relationships, SDK architecture, and key interaction flows

## Purpose

These user flow documents serve multiple purposes:

1. **Development Reference** - Provides developers with clear expectations for how features should work
2. **Test Coverage** - Documents which user journeys are being tested and validated
3. **Design Guide** - Helps UI/UX designers understand the underlying system behaviors
4. **Feature Planning** - Identifies potential gaps in functionality that need to be addressed

## Implementation Details

Each user flow document follows a consistent structure:

- **Test Identifier** - Links the flow to specific test cases
- **Description** - Explains the purpose and importance of the flow
- **User Journey** - Provides step-by-step details of the user interaction
- **Validations** - Outlines what's being checked and verified

These flows are implemented and validated through our test suite, ensuring the platform behaves as expected in all scenarios.
