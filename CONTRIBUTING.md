# Contributing to Tribes by Astrix

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Tribes by Astrix as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md or documentation with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of two maintainers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## Testing

Before submitting a pull request, make sure all tests pass:

```bash
npm test
```

If you're adding new functionality, please include appropriate tests.

## Code Style

Please follow the existing code style. We use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run format
```
